# Costar - Coding Standard Ruler  

This is a "PHP Coding Standard Generator" for creating a PHPCS (PHP CodeSniffer) or PHPMD (PHP Mass Detector)
configuration that can be saved in PMD-XML format.

However, it can be used to import existing PMD-XML rules for PHPCS or PHPMD so that they can be also edited.


### Problem

The official teams around "PHP CodeSniffer" (PHPCS) and "PHP Mass Detector" (PHPMD) unfortunately do not offer a
graphical user interface to configure all their rules in a more comfortable way.


### Solution

In small inspiration of an available but since February 2017 outdated
[PHP Coding Standard Generator](https://edorian.github.io/php-coding-standard-generator/#phpmd),
I made myself piece of work to build a new generator with the help of [Quasar](https://quasar.dev)
(without build on compilation).
